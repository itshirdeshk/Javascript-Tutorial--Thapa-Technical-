// Section 13 : Events in Javascript.

// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
// When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

// HTML Events
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

// Here are some examples of HTML events:

// An HTML web page has finished loading.
// An HTML input field was changed.
// An HTML button was clicked.
// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

// JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

// HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
